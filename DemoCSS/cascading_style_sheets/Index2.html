<h1>Those were the days</h1>

<p class="p1">Once upon a time there was a tavern<br>
    Where we used to raise a glass or two<br>
    Remember how we laughed away the hours<br>
    And dreamed of all the great things we would do</p>

<p id="p2">Those were the days my friend<br>
    We thought they'd never end<br>
    We'd sing and dance forever and a day<br>
    We'd live the life we choose<br>
    We'd fight and never lose<br>
    For we were young and sure to have our way.<br>
    La la la la...</p>

<p class="p1">Then the busy years went rushing by us<br>
    We lost our starry notions on the way<br>
    If by chance I'd see you in the tavern<br>
    We'd smile at one another and we'd say</p>

<p id="p3">Those were the days my friend<br>
    We thought they'd never end<br>
    We'd sing and dance forever and a day<br>
    We'd live the life we choose<br>
    We'd fight and never lose<br>
    Those were the days, oh yes those were the days<br>
    La la la la...</p>

<p>Just tonight I stood before the tavern<br>
    Nothing seemed the way it used to be<br>
    In the glass I saw a strange reflection<br>
    Was that lonely woman really me</p>

<p id="p4">Those were the days my friend<br>
    We thought they'd never end<br>
    We'd sing and dance forever and a day<br>
    We'd live the life we choose<br>
    We'd fight and never lose<br>
    Those were the days, oh yes those were the days<br>
    La la la la...</p>

<p class="p1">Through the door there came familiar laughter<br>
    I saw your face and heard you call my name<br>
    Oh my friend we're older but no wiser<br>
    For in our hearts the dreams are still the same</p>

<p id="p5">Those were the days my friend<br>
    We thought they'd never end<br>
    We'd sing and dance forever and a day<br>
    We'd live the life we choose<br>
    We'd fight and never lose<br>
    Those were the days, oh yes those were the days<br>
    La la la la...</p>
